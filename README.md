## The Common Data Set Archive for Higher Education Institutions in the United States of America

Applying to college and want to see how colleges compare with each other? Common Data Sets (CDSs) can help you! The [Common Data Set Initiative](https://commondataset.org/) tries to improve data reporting accuracy and quality. Each CDS contains standardized data items that colleges can opt to fill out. 

### Notes
- Some colleges may be listed multiple times; this may be because they have many campuses across the state/country
- Some colleges may be missing from the data
- Some CDS links may be missing from the data

### Support

If you notice any mistakes in the data (like a college that should be considered closed) or if you have found a college/CDS link that was missing, please provide the name of the college, the state, and the CDS link(s)!

Please create a pull request with the necessary information on **change_log.md**.

### Resources

By searching through the internet, we have collected links to colleges that have publicly available Common Data Sets. These colleges were found by going through the wikipedia pages for colleges in each state and the District of Columbia.
